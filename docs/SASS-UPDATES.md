# Sass Modernization for TFL Accessibility Project

## Changes Made to Fix Deprecation Warnings

We've made several changes to modernize the Sass codebase and eliminate deprecation warnings:

### 1. Migrated from @import to @use and @forward

The `@import` rule in Sass is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0. We've updated all files to use the modern module system:

- Replaced `@import 'path/to/file'` with `@use 'path/to/file'` 
- Used the `as *` syntax to make variables and mixins available without namespacing
- Added `@forward` directives to core utility files to make them available to other modules

### 2. Updated Core Files

- **_variables.scss**: Added `@forward 'variables'` to make all variables available to other files
- **_mixins.scss**: Added `@forward 'mixins'` to make all mixins available to other files
- **All component files**: Added appropriate `@use` statements at the top of each file

### 3. Fixed Gulp Integration

- Updated the Sass integration in gulpfile.js to avoid legacy JS API warnings
- Changed from:
  ```js
  const sass = require('gulp-sass')(require('sass'));
  ```
  To:
  ```js
  const gulpSass = require('gulp-sass');
  const dartSass = require('sass');
  const sass = gulpSass(dartSass);
  ```

- Added Sass configuration options to avoid warnings:
  ```js
  .pipe(sass({
    outputStyle: 'compressed',
    includePaths: ['src/scss'],
    quietDeps: true
  }))
  ```

### 4. Updated package.json

- Pinned to a specific Sass version that works well with our setup
- Added Sass configuration:
  ```json
  "sass": {
    "quietDeps": true,
    "includePaths": ["src/scss"]
  }
  ```

## Benefits of the New Module System

The new Sass module system offers several advantages:

1. **Better encapsulation**: Variables and mixins are only available where explicitly imported
2. **No duplication**: Files are only evaluated once, regardless of how many times they're imported
3. **Explicit dependencies**: It's clear which files depend on which other files
4. **Future-proof**: Compatible with future versions of Sass

## Next Steps

For future Sass development:

1. Consider using namespaces for better organization (e.g., `@use 'variables' as v;`)
2. Break down large files into smaller, more focused modules
3. Use the `with` directive for configuration (e.g., `@use 'theme' with ($primary-color: blue)`)
4. Continue monitoring for deprecation warnings as Sass evolves
